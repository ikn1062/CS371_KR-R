## CS371 Project - Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

The goal of this project is to extend the existing OpenCyc ontology and develop the knowledge representation and reasoning necessary to determine a firm’s 
financial health given specific input variables. The knowledge framework for this project will be a direct adaptation of the knowledge-based system created 
in the research paper “A frame knowledge system for managing financial decision knowledge”. 

The first aspect of this project involved developing the knowledge representation of the financial indicators needed to perform an evaluation on the 
financial health of a given company, which is based on four main areas, short-term liquidity (SL), Long-term solvency (LS), Profitability (P), and Utility (U), 
broken down into 13 dimensions. The second aspect involved creating a representation of the rules needed to allow us to determine financial health based on the 
indicators identified.
